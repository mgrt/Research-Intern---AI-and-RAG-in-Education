# Enhanced RAG Architecture and Math Assistance Chatbot for Engineering Students

Improved RAG Architecture: Developed a new Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that improved accuracy on a dataset of 500 probability questions from 42% to 62.7%, representing a 20.7% increase in performance. This improvement demonstrates significant progress in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of AI systems for complex problem-solving.

Math Assistance Chatbot: Implemented a chatbot specifically designed to assist engineering students with mathematics, providing real-time solutions and explanations. This chatbot leverages the enhanced RAG architecture to deliver accurate, context-aware responses.

Evaluation Pipeline: Created a robust evaluation pipeline for systematically assessing the performance of the chatbot. This pipeline ensures continuous improvements, allowing for thorough testing and refinement of the system's capabilities.
